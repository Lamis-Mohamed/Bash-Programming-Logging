**Practical Activity**

 

As a system Administrator 

Write a shell script to validate password strength when a user enters. 

Here are a few assumptions for the password string. 

Length – minimum of 8 characters. 

Contain both alphabet and number. 

Include both the small and capital case letters. 

If the password doesn’t comply with any of the above conditions, then the script should report it as a <Weak Password> if the password complies with the conditions, it should echo <Strong Password Secure User>
